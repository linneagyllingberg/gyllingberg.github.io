### The Lost Art of Mathematical Modelling
We provide a critique of mathematical biology in light of rapid developments in modern machine learning. We argue that out of the three modelling activities --- (1) formulating models; (2) analysing models; and (3) fitting or comparing models to data --- inherent to mathematical biology, researchers currently focus too much on activity (2) at the cost of (1). This trend, we propose, can be reversed by realising that any given biological phenomena can be modelled in an infinite number of different ways, through the adoption of an open/pluralistic approach. We explain the open approach using fish locomotion as a case study and illustrate some of the pitfalls --- universalism, creating models of models, etc. --- that hinder mathematical biology. We then ask how we might rediscover a lost art: that of creative mathematical modelling.

### Finding analytical approximations for discrete, stochastic, individual-based models of ecology
Discrete time, spatially extended models play an important role in ecology, modelling population dynamics of species ranging from micro-organisms to birds. An important question is how 'bottom up', individual-based models can be approximated by ’top down’ models of dynamics. Here, we study a class of spatially explicit individual-based models with contest competition: where species compete for space in local cells and then disperse to nearby cells. We start by describing simulations of the model, which exhibit large-scale discrete oscillations and characterise these oscillations by measuring spatial correlations. We then develop two new approximate descriptions of the resulting spatial population dynamics. The first is based on local interactions of the individuals and allows us to give a difference equation approximation of the system over small dispersal distances. The second approximates the long-range interactions of the individual-based model. These approximations capture demographic stochasticity from the individual-based model and show that dispersal stabilizes population dynamics. We calculate extinction probability for the individual-based model and show convergence between the local approximation and the non-spatial global approximation of the individual-based model as dispersal distance and population size simultaneously tend to infinity. Our results provide new approximate analytical descriptions of a complex bottom-up model and deepen understanding of spatial population dynamics.
