My research focuses on developing and analysing mathematical models and methods for different biological applications. I am also interested in philosophical aspects of mathematical modelling, as well as the limitations of machine learning in mathematical biology. 

## Collective behaviour and intelligence

In an ongoing project, I study the role of oscillations for learning in slime mould through mathematical models. 


While mathematical models, in particular self-propelled particle (SPP) models, capture many of the observed properties of large fish schools, they do not always capture the interactions of smaller shoals. Nor do these models tend to account for the observation that, when swimming alone or in smaller groups, many species of fish use intermittent locomotion, often referred to as burst and coast or burst and glide. Recent empirical studies have suggested that burst and glide movement are indeed pivotal to the social interactions of individual fish. In this paper, we propose a model of social burst and glide motion by combining a well-studied model of neuronal dynamics, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, with a model of fish motion.  We begin by showing that the model can capture the motion of a single fish swimming down a channel. By then extending to a two fish model, where visual stimuli of the position of the other fish affects the internal burst or glide state of the fish, we find that our model captures a rich set of swimming dynamics found in many species of fish. These include: leader-follower behaviour; periodic changes in leadership; apparently random (i.e. chaotic) leadership change; and pendulum-like tit-for-tat turn taking. Unlike SPP models, which assume that fish move at a constant speed, the model produces realistic motion of individual fish. Moreover, unlike previous studies where a random component is used for leadership switching to occur, we show that leadership switching, both periodic and chaotic, can be the result of a deterministic interaction.  We give several empirically testable predictions on how fish interact and discuss our results in light of recently established correlations between fish locomotion and brain activity.

## Spatial models in ecology and epidemology 
Spatial structure is critically important to understand and model many aspects of ecology as well as epidemiology. 

[comment]: # (In the following research projects I use spatial mathematical models to gain understanding)

### Modelling transmission of the of Covid-19 in Uppsala County - a metapopulation network approach
The duration and spatial proximity of social interactions between humans may play a critical role in the propagation of airborne diseases. Digital contact-tracing using GPS-based mobile apps can only generate macro-level data bound by legal restriction. In contrast, interview-based (clinical) contact-tracing can provide extensive anonymized data from people who test positive for COVID-19 allowing us to focus on social interactions that have actually contributed to transmission. Such contact-tracing methods have successfully been used during the COVID-19 control efforts, but their full potential has yet to be reached. The spatio-temporal data collected by contact-tracing combined with COVID-19 transmission indicators could help us identify transmission hot spots and paths. Our aim is to build a mathematical model in order to model the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Uppsala County.

### Spatial models in ecology - analytical approximations of individual based models of ecology
How does space affect population dynamics of a model with intra-specific interaction? In the paper *Finding analytical approximations for discrete, stochastic, individual-based models of ecology* we study an individual based model of intra-specific interactions, inspired by the life cycle of many insects and microorganisms. The model is simple to state, yet it gives rise to complex spatial patterns as well as population dynamics. We show that a mean-field approach is not enough to capture the complex spatial dynamics of ecological competition. Instead, we develop two approximations to capture this complexity: one based on coupling on a larger scale and one based on an approximation on a very local scale. Our findings shed light on a common discrepancy between theoretical and empirical ecology: theoretical models, as suggested by May et al. (1974) often show chaotic behaviour, but in real ecological time series chaos is infrequent.
