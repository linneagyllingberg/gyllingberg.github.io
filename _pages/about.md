I am a Ph.D. candidate in applied mathematics at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en){:target="_blank"}, Sweden, advised by
[David Sumpter](https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N7-525){:target="_blank"}. 

My research focuses on developing and analysing mathematical models and methods for different biological applications.
