I am a Ph.D. candidate in applied mathematics at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en){:target="_blank"} within the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics](https://www.math.uu.se/research/cim/){:target="_blank"}, Sweden, advised by
[David Sumpter](https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N7-525){:target="_blank"}. I am a part of the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.uu.se/?languageId=1){:target="_blank"} as well as the [Division of Systems and Control](https://www.it.uu.se/about_us/divisions/systems_and_control){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on developing and analysing mathematical models and methods for different biological applications. I use from dynamical systems, network models and agent-based modelling to understand collective behaviour, desicion making and complex systems.
